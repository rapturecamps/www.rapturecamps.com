## D. NOTABLE ISSUES & INCONSISTENCIES

1. **URL slugs don't match page names**: Portugal camps use compound slugs (`ericeira-lizandro`, `alentejo-milfontes`, `ericeira-coxos-surf-villa`) that differ from the display names
2. **Duplicate content**: Milfontes has the "Peaceful vacations with a conscient mindset" section repeated twice with slightly different wording
3. **Heading hierarchy inconsistencies**: Morocco Banana Village and Nicaragua Surf Resort use H3 for main sections where other pages use H2
4. **H1 format inconsistencies**: Some have trailing periods, some don't; some include "Rapture" prefix, some don't; "Surfcamp" vs "Surf Camp"
5. **Booking slug inconsistencies**: `surf-stay` vs `surf-and-stay` vs abbreviated slugs
6. **Milfontes FAQ links to Ericeira FAQs** instead of its own
7. **Title tag format varies**: Some use "Rapture Surfcamps" suffix, Ericeira uses "Best Surf Camp in Portugal" — no consistent pattern
8. **Dinner schedules differ**: Most camps serve Mon-Fri, Nicaragua camps serve Sun-Thu
9. **No Bali country page** in the site structure (camp page exists directly)
10. **Coxos Surf Villa** depends on Ericeira Lizandro camp for lessons/activities — tight coupling between two properties
11. **Nicaragua Maderas Surf Resort** is partner-managed (Todo Bien resort) — different business model than other camps
12. **Costa Rica Avellanas** mentions facilities "still in construction" — stale content if construction is complete
