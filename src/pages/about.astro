          Rapture Surfcamps was born in 2003 when an Australian photographer
          and an Austrian entrepreneur decided to combine their passion for
          surfing with their love of travel. What started as a single surf
          house in Morocco has grown into a global network of 8 unique surf
          camps across 5 countries on 4 continents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past two decades, we've welcomed more than 85,000
          guests from every corner of the globe. From first-time surfers
          catching their very first wave to seasoned pros hunting barrels,
          our camps are built around one simple idea: sharing the joy of
          surfing in incredible locations with a community of like-minded
          adventurers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Rapture camp is owner-operated by surfers who know the local
          breaks inside and out. We're not a faceless chain — each camp
          has its own personality, its own vibe, and its own magic.
        </p>

          Whether you're drawn to the tropical perfection of Bali, the
          Pura Vida spirit of Costa Rica, the raw beauty of Morocco, the
          wild Atlantic coast of Portugal, or the unspoiled shores of
          Nicaragua — there's a Rapture camp waiting for you.
