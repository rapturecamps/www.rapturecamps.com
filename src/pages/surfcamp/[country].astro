        body: "<p>Nicaragua is blessed with 330 days of offshore winds per year — one of the most consistent surf destinations on the planet. The dry season (November–April) brings clean conditions and overhead swells to Playa Maderas, while the rainy season (May–October) offers bigger waves with fewer crowds.</p><p>Water temperature sits at a balmy 27–29°C year-round. Boardshorts and a rash vest are all you need.</p>",

Choose between private rooms and unique glamping tents — either way, you'll wake up to birdsong and ocean views.</p><p>Surf guiding is included six days a week for intermediate and advanced surfers. For a more boutique experience, the Maderas Surf Resort offers premium accommodation with a laid-back vibe and easy access to San Juan del Sur's nightlife, just 30 minutes away.</p>",
